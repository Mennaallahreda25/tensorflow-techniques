The main difference between `Conv2D` and `Conv3D` lies in the dimensionality of the data they operate on.
 `Conv2D` is a two-dimensional convolutional layer typically used for processing two-dimensional spatial 
data, such as images. It analyzes the data by sliding a small window (called a filter or kernel)
 across the input image and computing dot products between the filter and the local patches of the image.
 It is particularly effective at capturing spatial relationships and patterns in images. On the other
 hand, `Conv3D` is a three-dimensional convolutional layer used for processing three-dimensional data,
 such as video sequences or volumetric medical images.
It extends the concept of `Conv2D` to an additional temporal dimension. In addition to capturing spatial 
patterns like `Conv2D`, `Conv3D` also considers temporal information by sliding the filter across 
the entire spatiotemporal volume. 

When to use `Conv2D`: - 
When working with two-dimensional spatial data, such as images, where spatial relationships and patterns
 are important. - For tasks that do not involve temporal information, such as image classification, 
object detection, or image segmentation. 

When to use `Conv3D`: - 
When working with three-dimensional spatiotemporal data, such as video sequences or volumetric medical
images, where both spatial and temporal relationships are relevant. - For tasks that require analyzing 
motion or change over time, such as action recognition, video processing, or 3D medical image analysis. 
In summary, `Conv2D` is suitable for two-dimensional spatial data, while `Conv3D` is designed for 
three-dimensional spatiotemporal data. The choice between the two depends on the nature of the data and 
the specific task at hand.
